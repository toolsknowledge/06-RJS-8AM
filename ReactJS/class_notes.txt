public/favicon.ico
++++++++++++++++++
    this is a default logo of reactjs


public/index.html
+++++++++++++++++
    this html is the "main" html file

    this html is the "entry" point of react application

    react starts the execution from "index.html" file

    react applications are "component" based

    we can create more than one component

    as a react developer we can provide communication between components

    as a react developer we can include one component to another component

    after creating the component we must register in "index.js" file

    index.js file will handover to "div" which is present in "index.html" file

   /App.css
   /App.test.js
***************
    when ever we create the react application, automatically App Component is the default component


src/index.css
*************
    here, we will define the global styles

    these styles applicable to entire react project

src/index.js
************
    this file acting as Registration file.

    render() is the predefined function in ReactDOM class

    render() handovers the component to div (whose id is root and present in index.html file)

************
    this is default svg logo of reactjs
